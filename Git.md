✅ Goal:
Keep current main branch changes AND bring in the changes from 4221f78.

✅ Recommended Solution: Cherry-pick the merge commit into main
Since 4221f78 is a merge commit, use git cherry-pick with the -m option to replay its changes into main.

🔄 Step-by-step:
Ensure you're on main:

git checkout main
Make sure your working directory is clean:

git status
If there are untracked or uncommitted changes, stash or commit them.

Cherry-pick the merge commit into main:

git cherry-pick -m 1 4221f78
-m 1: Tells Git to use parent 1 (typically the base branch, like main) when replaying a merge commit.

This will reapply the changes from 4221f78 on top of your current main — merging both.

Resolve any merge conflicts if prompted, then:

git add .
git cherry-pick --continue
Push your updated main:

git push origin main
📝 Summary
✅ After this, your main branch will include:

All current changes

All changes from the old merge commit 4221f78
